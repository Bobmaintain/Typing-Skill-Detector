    'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth',
    'There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.',
    'I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation', 
    'I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule.',
    'What one man can invent another can discover.',
    'Nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person.',

    'Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius.',
    'You have a grand gift for silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.',
    'What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence. The question is what can you make people believe you have done.',
    'It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but that you are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it.',
    'Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell.',
    'A man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman\'s love, however badly he may have treated her.',
    'I wanted to end the world, but I\'ll settle for ending yours.',

    'There is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellowmen.',

    'You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.',
    'Show Holmes a drop of water and he would deduce the existence of the Atlantic. Show it to me and I would look for a tap. That was the difference between us.',
    'I cannot live without brainwork. What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the duncoloured houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material?',
    'It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.',

    'It has always seemed to me that so long as you produce your dramatic effect, accuracy of detail matters little. I have never striven for it and I have made some bad mistakes in consequence. What matter if I hold my readers?',
    'Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.',
