# Typing-Skill-Detector
This is a Typing Skill Detector built in form of a game. It tests a player's typing  skill,  which  is  one  of  the  most  underrated  skills  all  developers  should  have.  We  should all  be  practicing  our  typing!    
The  general  flow  of  the  game is: 
1. Player clicks  on  start  button  and  is  presented  with  a quote to type. 
2. Player  types  the  quote as quickly as they can in a textbox  
3. As each word is completed, the next one is highlighted.  
4. If  the  player  has  a typo,  the textbox  is  updated to red  
5. When the player completes the quote, a success message is displayed with the elapsed time.  
Have fun!
